    "Performance diagrams are an important tool in understanding ... As you might recall, to analyze performance diagrams it is vital to distinguish between jet and propeller aircraft. \n",

    "### Jet aircraft \n",
    "For a jet engine, the thrust produced is fairly independent of airspeed. As a result, visually it is depicted as a horizontal line. To understand the drag encountered, begin with the preliminary equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho C_D \\cdot V^2 \\cdot S $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, recall that the drag coefficient of the aircraft can be written as some function of the lift coefficient i.e., $C_D = f(C_L)$. Assuming a two term drag polar, the following can be noted:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C_D = C_{D,0} + \\frac{C_L^2}{\\pi A e} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $C_{D,0}$ is the zero life drag coefficient, $e$ is the efficiency factor,- and $A$ is the aspect ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this equation, the preliminary drag equation can be rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D= \\frac{1}{2} C_{D,0} \\cdot \\rho \\cdot V^2 \\cdot S + \\frac{C_{L}^2}{\\pi A e} \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\rho V^2 \\cdot S $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation indicates a quadratic relation between drag and velocity, which is not entirely true. Please note to fully analyse the equation one must realise despite increasing velocity we do not increase lift! Hence the lift coefficient must decrease accordingly. If this were not the case, excess lift would be produced.. In other words, lift is equal to weight and therefore: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{2} C_L \\rho V^2 S = W \\Rightarrow C_L \\frac{2W}{\\rho \\cdot V^2 \\cdot S} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting this relation into the drag equation one obtains: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D = \\frac{1}{2} C_{D,0} \\rho V^2 S + \\frac{2W^2}{\\pi A e \\rho V^2 S} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the relation between velocity and drag is not parabolic but rather hyperbolic!! This is also seen clearly in figure [INSERT FIGURE]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having seen the derivation of drag, power required follows systematically. As the power required is simply defined by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P_{\\text{required}} = DV $$\n"
