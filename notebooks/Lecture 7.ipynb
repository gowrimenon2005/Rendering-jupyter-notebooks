    "## Roadmap of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the last lecture! This lecture is a quite special as it zooms out on system modelling we have done so far. As before, a roadmap of the lecture is presented. Should you feel a little lost or in need of some context, this roadmap serves to provide you glimpse of the larger picture. If there are any sections you would like to jump to or revisit, feel free to directly skip ahead. This notebook begins with the [Lecture Objectives](#lecture-objectives), and directly dives into [Modelling](#modelling). This section expands on the assumptions made, and how the model can be augmented. This is followed by deriving the equations of motion for three-dimensional flight. To do so, firstly the required [Vector Transformations](#vector-transformations) are elaborated on. The results of this section are used to derive the [Generalised Equations of Motion](#generalised-equations-of-motion). Lastly, the main [Conclusions](#conclusion) are summarised. "

    "## Modelling \n",
    "\n",
    "So far the system model used has been based on 15 variables and 12 governing equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Doing so, there are 6 variables that are not independently described by any equation. These six variables are:\n",
    "1. Velocity, $V$\n",
    "2. Flight path angle, $\\gamma$\n",
    "3. Altitude, $h$\n",
    "4. Thrust, $T$\n",
    "5. Lift coefficient, $C_L$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The first three variables in this list are known as *state variables*, the following two are *input variables* and the last variable is an *independent variable*. Though the names may seem arbitrary, these variable types are commonly used in several disciplines. They can be defined as follows:\n",
    "1. **State variables**: these variables completely describe the current status of the system for the given conditions of the independent variable(s)\n",
    "2. **Input variables (controls)**: these variables must be assigned to influence the evolution of the system\n",
    "3. **Independent variables**: these variables are independent of the system states and inputs\n",
    "evolution of model \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, by considering the introduction of these new variable types, it becomes clear that the system model is well posed as there are 15 variables to accompany 15 equations. You may wonder where the addition three equations stem from, but realise these equations now simply define the controls and independent variable. In other words, the set of 15 equations consist of:\n",
    "- 3 Equations of motion - these describe the three states \n",
    "- 9 Model equations composed of:\n",
    "    - 6 constants \n",
    "    - 1 atmospheric model equation \n",
    "    - 2 aerodynamic model equations \n",
    "- 2 Controls - for thrust, and the lift coefficient \n",
    "- 1 Independent variable - time \n",
    "\n",
    "This is therefore, a well posed problem, however still based on a number of underlying and in some cases inadequate assumptions. In the remainder of this section we augment this system model step-by-step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Augmenting the thrust model \n",
    "At this point, one may choose to transform thrust (which is now a control) into a model. To do so, it is important to realise thrust is dependent on the maximum thrust of the engine, the altitude and the Mach number. Mach number is dependent on the speed of sound, of which both (Mach number and speed of sound) were not previously defined. This introduces four addition variables and four addition equations. Thus, the total number of governing equations is as follows:\n",
    "- 3 Equations of motion - these describe the three states \n",
    "- 13 Model equations composed of:\n",
    "    - 6 constants \n",
    "    - 3 atmospheric model equation \n",
    "    - 2 aerodynamic model equations \n",
    "    - 2 propulsive model equations\n",
    "- 2 Controls - for throttle setting and lift coefficient \n",
    "- 1 Independent variable - time \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the problem still remains well posed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Augmenting the $C_L$ model\n",
    "Similar to augmenting the thrust model, to transform the lift coefficient from being a control to a model, dependencies of the lift coefficient must be considered. The lift coefficient is dependent on the angle of attack, the zero-lift angle of attack and the lift slope. This introduces three new variables, two of which are constants and one is a model equation, i.e.:\n",
    "- 3 Equations of motion - these describe the three states \n",
    "- 16 Model equations composed of:\n",
    "    - 8 constants \n",
    "    - 3 atmospheric model equation \n",
    "    - 3 aerodynamic model equations \n",
    "    - 2 propulsive model equations\n",
    "- 2 Controls - for throttle setting and angle of attack\n",
    "- 1 Independent variable - time \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the problem remains well posed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Augmenting the $\\alpha_T$ model\n",
    "Previously it was assumed that $\\alpha_T =0$. However, this does not have to be the case. By introducing the anagle of attack, $\\alpha_T$ can be expressed in terms of angle of attack and some other constant $\\mu_T$. This results in the addition of one equation and one equation. You may argue this introduces two new equations, however recall that we are removing the previous equation used for $\\alpha_T$ in this process, hence the problem is well posed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Augmenting the FF model \n",
    "So far we have assumed weight is constant, however in reality as fuel is burned the weight fo the aircraft continuously decreases. To introduce this consideration into the system, let us introduce the fuel flow parameter which is equal to the time rate of change of the aircraft's weight. To implement this into the system a new formulation of dynamics is required (as the state equations were previously defined assuming constant weight). Thus, the point mass system in longitudinal flight (3 degrees of freedom) now becomes a rigid body with variable mass inertia in three-dimensional flight (6 degrees of freedom). \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course this notion can be extended! The aircraft is in reality composed of many rigid bodies all connected through constrained equations and some flexible structures. Furthermore, these subsystems would be subjected to their own system dynamics. For instance when augmenting the aero-propulsive model, the coupling between aerodynamic and propulsive forces must be considered. Such considerations, can have profound implications of the performance of the aircraft and hence is detrimental to consider during the design phase. "

    "## Vector transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Although augmenting the dynamic model completely exceeds the scope of this course, it is possible to redefine our equations of motion into three-dimensional space. This formulation is pivotal for being able to solve more advanced problems. For instance, if an aircraft is climbing and turning then the problem is too complicated to solve using the equations for generic longitudinal motion. With this is mind, let us formalize a methodology to derive the translation equations of motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, let consider two basic vector transformations: translations and/or rotations. This has been discussed extensively in prior courses, however is reiterated for your convenience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an initial vector, $\\vec{R_0}$ in an inertial reference frame and some arbitrary vector, $\\vec{r}$ in a moving reference frame. When considering pure translation, we consider the case where the moving reference frame is parallel to the inertial reference frame. Then the new vector composed of the sum of these two vectors, denoted as $\\vec{R}$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{R} = \\vec{R_0} + \\vec{r} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{R} = \\begin{bmatrix} X_0 + x \\\\ Y_0 + y \\\\ Z_0 + z \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the same problem, however the moving reference frame is not parallel to the inertial reference frame. In such a case, the vector sum is still valid however this is not equal to the sum of components directly. The different orientation of the moving reference frame must be taken into account. This results in following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{R} \\neq \\begin{bmatrix} X_0 + x \\\\ Y_0 + y \\\\ Z_0 + z \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](Images\\lec7-rot-trans.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we consider the moving reference frame to be rotated by an angle $\\phi$ abound the X axis of the inertial reference frame. Thus to be able to calculate the component, we transform the vectors into the same reference frame. This is done by using rotation matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "To derive these rotation matrices, we consider the following. We know that the moving refernce frame is simply a rotiation of the inertial reference frame by an angle $\\phi$ over the X axis. Thus, the axes of both reference frames can be depicted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](Images\\lec7-ref-frame.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there exist two vectors $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{r}_m$. $\\vec{r}$ has the following components in the inertial reference frame:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{r} = \\begin{bmatrix} X \\\\ Y \\\\ Z \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, $\\vec{r}_m$ has the following components in the moving reference frame: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{r}_m = \\begin{bmatrix} x_m \\\\ y_m \\\\ z_m \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{r}_m = \\begin{bmatrix} X \\\\ Y \\cos \\phi Z \\sin \\phi \\\\ Y \\sin \\phi - Z \\cos \\phi \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{r}_m = T_1(\\phi)\\vec{r} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, \n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, the inverse transformation can be written as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{r} = T_1^T(\\phi)\\vec{r}_m $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, that these roation matrices are orthogonal and hence the inverse is equilvalent to the transpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the rotation matrices for rotations about Y and Z axis of the inertial refernce frame are given below\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_2(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos{\\theta} & 0 & -\\sin{\\theta} \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ \\sin{\\theta} & 0 & \\cos{\\theta} \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
