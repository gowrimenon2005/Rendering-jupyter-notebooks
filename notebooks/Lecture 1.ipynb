    "## Roadmap of this lecture\n",
    "Hello there! Welcome to first lecture of the seven-part series. To guide you, a roadmap of the lecture is presented. Should you feel a little lost or in need of some context, this roadmap serves to provide you glimpse of the larger picture. If there are any sections you would like to jump to or revisit, feel free to directly skip ahead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the [Lecture Objectives](#lec-obj) are stated. These should help you understand what to expect and more importantly inform you of what you are expected to be able to do. It is wise to revisit these objectives once you have understood the content. Thereafter, the framework for all our analysis is given under [Kinematics and Dynamics](#kinematics-and-dynamics). Using this [Steady Climb Performance](#steady-climb) is investigated. Furthermore, [En-route Climb Procedures and Performance](#en-route-climb-p-p) are explored. Lastly, the main [Conclusions](#conclusion) are summarised, and short of preview of the next lecture is given in the section [What next?](#what-next). \n"

    "Prior to beginning with any form of performance prediction, it is quintessential to understand the assumptions made and their implications. Here, we will limit ourselves to considering unsteady, symmetric flight under constant mass. This assumption is three-fold, the implications shall be considered separately. \n",
    "1. Unsteady flight implies that the forces and moments action on the body do vary in time, in either magnitude or direction. This can be mathematically written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} \\neq 0 \\space \\text{and} \\space \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} \\neq 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Symmetric flight implies that both the angle of sideslip is zero and the plane of symmatery is perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the Earth. \n",
    "3. Constant mass simply states that the mass of the body is assumed to remain constant throughout the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these assumptions, the following free body diagram can be drawn:\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](Images\\lec1-fbd-gen-eom.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these assumptions and the figure above, the general equations of motions can be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T\\cos{\\alpha_T} -D -W \\sin{\\gamma} = \\frac{W}{g}\\dot{V} \\\\ L + T\\sin{\\alpha_T} - W\\cos{\\gamma} = \\frac{W}{g}V\\dot{\\gamma}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under some circumstances, these equations simplify. The two most common situations to consider are under steady flight, and under the small angle approximation. Firstly, in the case of steady flight under a rectilinear trajectory, the rate of change of velocity and flight path angle are zero, hence the equations of motion become:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T\\cos{\\alpha_T} -D -W \\sin{\\gamma} = 0 \\\\ L + T\\sin{\\alpha_T} - W\\cos{\\gamma} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in the case of gentle climbs and descents that is, if $|\\gamma| << 1$ then $\\cos \\gamma \\approx 1$ and $\\sin \\gamma \\approx \\gamma$. The same is applicable for the thrust angle, $\\alpha_T$. In addition, provided the thrust to weight ratio of the aircraft is approximately 0.2/0.3 it can, conservatively, be assumed that: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T \\sin \\alpha_T << W \\cos \\gamma$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In which case the general steady equations of motion become:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T -D -W \\sin{\\gamma} = 0 \\\\ L - W = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, even though the small angle approximation suggests the use of $\\gamma$ rather than $\\sin \\gamma$ as the coefficient for weight, when performing computations the complexity is the same and hence $\\sin \\gamma$ is used. \n",

    "## Steady Climb Performance \n",
    "\n",
    "To consider steady climb performance, let us revisit the applicable equations of motion, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T -D -W \\sin{\\gamma} = 0 \\\\ L - W = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation provides the relation between the angle of climb, thrust required and thrust available. This is because the term $\\sin \\gamma$ is the angle of climb, $D$ is the drag (in other words the thrust required), and $T$ is the thrust avaiable. This equation can be rearranged to obtain an explicit equation for the angle of climb: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sin \\gamma = \\frac{T - D}{W}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is known that the rate of climb is simply the angle of climb multiplied by the velocity. With this in mind, let us multiply the angle of climb equation by velocity to obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ TV - DV -WV \\sin \\gamma = 0 \\Rightarrow V \\sin \\gamma = \\frac{TV - DV}{W}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The implicit form of the equation is known as the power equation, as it illustrates the relation between the power available, $TV$, power required, $DV$, and the rate of climb, $V \\sin \\gamma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To gain a more intuitive understanding, recall that the rate of climb can also be defined as the rate of change of altitude. Furthermore, recall that altitude is the potential energy per unit weight. Combining these two trains of thought:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{TV - DV}{W} = \\frac{P_a - P_r}{W} = V \\sin \\gamma = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (E_p/W)}{\\partial t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is insightful because it demonstrates the difference between the available and required power is equivalent to the rate of change of potential energy - which is what you would intuitively expect (excess power allows us to climb)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The following plot visualises how the thrust available - thrust required diagram and angle of climb. Alter the inputs yourself to see the plots for different aircrafts!"

    "The plots above were all concerned at sea-level. However, an important consideration is how performance changes with altitude. The effect of altitude arises from the difference in air density. With decreasing air density the power required curves experience a horizontal translation to the right and an upward displacement. Similarly, the power available curves have lower gradients. Hence, the rate of climb decreases as altitude increases. To visualise this result, enter a desired altitude and see how the plots compare to sea-level!"

    "Based on the different types of airspeeds introduced, it becomes clear that the analysis considered thus far has assumed steady flight, implying constant true airspeed. Alternatively one could consider flying with constant indicated airspeed. From a practical perspective, flying at constant indicated airspeed is a more convenient task for the pilot. This is because flying at constant true airspeed requires that the pilot continuously calculates what the true airspeed is. \n",

This increase in TAS is not monotonic as there exists a Mach number that may not be exceeded. Hence the increase of TAS with altitude is plotted in the figure below. \n",

Again as before, we begin our analysis with the equations of motion, however now without the assumption of steady flight. Please note the trajectory is still assumed to be quasi-rectilinear.

    "Unlike before, on the right-hand side of the equation there exists an additional term along with the rate of climb.
